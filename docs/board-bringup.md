# Bringing up a new board

Copy the closest existing board and change only what the evidence says to change. Adding a board is
data, not code.

| Step                   | Who   | Rough time |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Serial                 | human | 20 min     |
| Evidence + backup      | both  | 40 min     |
| Device tree            | agent | 30 min     |
| Board data             | agent | 15 min     |
| Build + verify offline | agent | 5 min      |
| Validate               | both  | 1–2 h      |

## Serial first (human, blocking)

The only view of U-Boot, early boot, and any hang before networking. Nothing else starts until it
works.

1. Open the case — plastic pry tool; clips, not glue.
2. Find the 3–4 pin header, usually near the SD slot or the SoC.
3. **Find GND** with a meter: powered box, measure each pin against exposed metal (USB shell, SD
   cage, Ethernet jack). GND reads 0 V; of the rest 3V3 reads highest, TX/RX a few mV below.
4. Wire **GND, TX, RX only**, crossed. Never connect 3V3 — the box is self-powered and tying rails
   can backfeed.
5. `tio -b 1500000 -L --log-file boot.log /dev/…`, then power-cycle.

**Gate:** the vendor boot log scrolls.

- The adapter must be **3.3 V FT232 or CH340**. A CP2102 cannot do 1.5 Mbaud and prints plausible
  garbage.
- TX/RX is a coin flip. Swapping harms nothing, but unplug and replug the adapter between attempts.

**Record** in `docs/<board>/`: pad location, pinout with the square pad marked, board photo.

## Evidence, then backup (blocking)

The box's own firmware is the specification. Capture it before changing anything.

1. Boot stock Android and get a shell (serial, or `adb` over the network). If neither works the DTB
   and partitions can still be carved from the eMMC later, but `dmesg`/`getprop` are lost — try
   first.
2. Dump to `stock/<board>/`: `dmesg`, `cmdline`, `getprop`, `/proc/iomem`, `lsmod`, partition table,
   Wi-Fi/BT firmware from `/vendor`.
3. **Full eMMC image → `backup/<board>/emmc-full.img`**; verify byte count =
   `/sys/block/<dev>/size × 512`. ~25 min at 100 Mb/s — start on the device tree while it runs.
4. Carve `factory_idbloader.bin` (sector 64, 4096 sectors) → `firmware/<board>/`.
5. Carve `board.dtb` out of the eMMC image — see below.

**Gate, no exceptions:** the eMMC dump exists off-box and its size is verified. It is the only route
back to Android once you migrate.

### The DTB must come from the dump, never from `/proc/device-tree`

`/sys/firmware/fdt` and `/proc/device-tree` give the tree **after U-Boot has edited it**, and the
edits are not cosmetic. On the R69 the bootloader adds two `/memreserve/` entries, `serial-number`,
the `memory` node, `chosen/bootargs`, initrd pointers, a `drm_logo` reservation and TVE overscan
margins, and **rewrites the SoC `compatible` from `rockchip,rk3518` to `rockchip,rk3528a`**. Take
that as the factory tree and you document properties the vendor never shipped.

On this family the base DTB sits inside the `boot` partition (Android boot image, header v2 — there
is no `resource` partition). Find it by its `d00dfeed` magic and read `totalsize` from the next four
bytes:

```sh
# boot partition start comes from the GPT; two identical copies exist, either will do
python3 - <<'EOF'
import struct
buf = open('backup/<board>/emmc-full.img','rb')
buf.seek(51200*512); d = buf.read(64*1024*1024)
i = d.find(b'\xd0\x0d\xfe\xed')
open('stock/<board>/board.dtb','wb').write(d[i:i+struct.unpack('>I', d[i+4:i+8])[0]])
EOF
```

Keep a runtime blob too, as `board-runtime.dtb` — its diff against the pristine one is the only
record of what the bootloader does. Derive from the pristine one.

## Device tree

Derive `board.dtb` from the box's own factory Android DTB, never from a reference board's. Apply
only these grafts, each with a functional consumer:

| Graft                                               | Consumer                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| debug uart `status` → `okay` + its `xfer` pinctrl   | `ttyS0` console                                                   |
| `fiq-debugger` → `disabled`                         | frees that UART for `ttyS0`                                       |
| IR `remote_support_psci` → `1`                      | remote wakes the box from off                                     |
| GPU → lima `clocks`/`clock-names`/`interrupt-names` | Armbian uses mainline lima                                        |
| LEDs → labels `power`/`standby`, `retain-state-*`   | the shared LED hooks                                              |
| `watchdog` → `okay`                                 | systemd `RuntimeWatchdogSec`                                      |
| board `compatible` prepend                          | only if a driver keys firmware lookup off it                      |
| SoC `compatible` append                             | only if userspace can't name the SoC without it — the codec check |
| `model` → the box's own name                        | identifies the board; the factory string names the reference EVB  |

**The watchdog graft carries a hazard.** Once something opens `/dev/watchdog` it cannot be disarmed
short of a reset, and it keeps counting across a soft reboot. Check the board's watchdog clock
before trusting any timeout figure — `watchdog.md` has the arithmetic and the operational rule.

**Why the LED grafts look odd.** `retain-state-shutdown` / `retain-state-suspended` stop the LED
core clearing the LED at shutdown and applying `LED_CORE_SUSPENDRESUME`, which would fight the
`system-shutdown` / `system-sleep` hooks over which LED is lit. DT can express only half of it
anyway: it turns the blue LED **off** at poweroff, but nothing in DT turns the red one **on**
(`default-on` fires at probe, `panic-indicator` at panic). So the policy lives entirely in the hooks
and the tree just keeps the kernel's hands off.

**Leave everything else factory.** If nothing consumes it, don't graft it. Most
`status = "disabled"` nodes are unwired on that PCB (i2c, spi, spare uarts/pwms, audio codecs):
Rockchip's SoC dtsi disables everything and the board file enables what's wired. Only in-SoC blocks
needing no board routing are candidates.

- **The grafts live in `firmware/<board>/board.patch`**; `upstream/build.sh` produces
  `firmware/<board>/board.dts` + `.dtb` from it under `SYNC=1`, and otherwise just reports that the
  two differ. Edit the patch, never `firmware/` — except where a board diverges on purpose, which
  belongs in its `dtb.md` with the condition that ends it.
- **Verify the tree round-trips** before rebuilding:
  `diff <(dtc -I dtb -O dts board.dtb) <(dtc -I dtb -O dts <(dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb board.dts))`. If
  it doesn't, edit with `fdtput` instead.
- **Diff the result against the factory tree**; the only differences must be your grafts.
- **One change per test DTB**, serial attached. Two at once cost a day of not knowing which hung the
  boot.
- Record every change in `docs/<board>/dtb.md`, including tried and reverted ones.

## Board data

Copy the closest `firmware/<board>/` and edit: `board.conf` (`BOARD_HOSTNAME`, `BOARD_PREFIX`,
`BOARD_WANTS`, the two hooks), `payload.list`, `board-id`, `board-name` (the login banner — carry
the PCB silkscreen, since these boxes vary between production runs), plus the DTB and idbloader.
Create `docs/<board>/`, starting `worklog.md` on day one, and add the board to the README's Boxes
table and support matrix.

- **Anything that must exist on a running box goes in `payload.list`**: that one list is consumed by
  both `build-image.sh` and `rk35xx-update`, so it cannot drift. Only one-time image surgery (raw
  loader `dd`, `armbianEnv.txt`, hostname rebrand) belongs in the build script.
- **Deleting from an image needs the patched `e2rm`** — `./build-e2tools.sh`, which `build-image.sh`
  requires. Stock `e2rm` corrupts ext4 two ways: it frees a fast symlink's target string as block
  numbers (multiply-claimed metadata block → read-only rootfs on first boot), and it unlinks a
  directory without freeing it. Both are silent until the box mounts.
- **Never bake in user preferences or big compiled userspace.** An HDMI `video=` pin would cap every
  4K TV to suit one PC monitor; a Kodi/ffmpeg-MPP stack would break the property that makes this
  repo cheap. Document those as recipes.

## Verify the image offline

Cheaper here than on the box. Attach the built image and check:

- **Loaders byte-identical** to `firmware/<board>/factory_idbloader.bin` (sector 64) and
  `firmware/common/u-boot.itb` (16384) — `dd` + `md5`.
- **DTB** matches `firmware/<board>/board.dtb`; `armbianEnv.txt` has `fdtfile` + the `ttyS0` args.
- **Identity dir** populated: `board-id`, `board-name`, `board.dtb`, both loaders.
- **No other board's names leaked** — grep `/usr/local/sbin`, `/etc/kernel/postinst.d`,
  `/usr/lib/systemd/system-*`, `/usr/src`.
- **Filesystem clean** — the build's `fsck.ext4 -fn` gate must have passed.

Validation is the last gate, and it has its own criteria list.
