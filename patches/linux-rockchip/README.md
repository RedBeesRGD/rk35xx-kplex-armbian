# linux-rockchip — kernel patches

Board-independent fixes for `armbian/linux-rockchip`, the vendor kernel these images run. They are
**not applied by this repo**: Armbian's `patch/kernel/<family>/` and `userpatches/kernel/<family>/`
only run when you build the kernel, and an overlay box takes its kernel from `apt`. They live here
so the work survives, and because the bugs they describe are visible on both boards.

| Patch                                    | PR            | Fixes                                                                       |

**#524 is worth more than the rest combined for log hygiene.** One WARN at probe emits its call
trace and register dump — ~416 lines, 78% of all err/warn on the R69 and 82% on the H96 Max.

**`drm-rockchip-tve-init-preferred-mode` stays unsubmitted until the driver it fixes has been run.**
`ROCKCHIP_DRM_TVE` is off in `linux-rk35xx-vendor`, so no kernel here has ever built
`rockchip_drm_tve.c`; the bug is read out of the source, not off a box. The board tree sets
`rockchip,tvemode` explicitly, which sidesteps it either way. `docs/todo/rk35xx-cvbs-tve.md` holds
what has to happen before this is worth sending.

**`mmc-dw-mmc-rockchip-per-host-inherit` stays unsubmitted: neither board can trigger the bug, and
neither can be made to.** It needs two enabled `dw_mci` controllers both taking the v2 tuning path,
contending over a function-scope static.

|         | `mmc@ffc20000` SDIO             | `mmc@ffc30000` SD                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| R69     | v2-tuning, UHS — **tunes**      | v2-tuning, UHS stripped — never tunes |
| H96 Max | no v2-tuning, UHS — non-v2 path | v2-tuning, UHS stripped — never tunes |

One v2 consumer each, so no contention. Restoring `sd-uhs-*` would not change it either: the R69's
SD has no `vqmmc-supply` and so no 1.8 V switch to run UHS with at all, and the H96 Max's SDIO does
not declare `use-v2-tuning`, so it stays on the non-v2 path however its SD is configured. The bug is
real — a per-host decision in a static is wrong regardless — but we cannot make it fire, and sending
it unverified would be publishing a recipe we have not run.

To build a kernel with these, copy into `patch/kernel/rk35xx-vendor-6.1/` or
`userpatches/kernel/rk35xx-vendor-6.1/` of an `armbian/build` checkout; both are applied
automatically.
