# Regenerate firmware/<board>/uboot.dts from that board's factory U-Boot DTB.
#
# Two stages, so each is auditable on its own:
#   1. mechanical — decompile the blob, then renumber every CRU clock/reset specifier from the
#      vendor's numbering to mainline's. The blob records only integers and no decompiler can
#      recover which symbol produced one, so the vendor header is the dictionary that names it and
#      mainline's header supplies the new value. Nothing that fails to map exactly is touched.
#   2. judgement — apply firmware/<board>/uboot.patch, which says what we change and why.
