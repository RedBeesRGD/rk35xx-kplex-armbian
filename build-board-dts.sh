# Regenerate firmware/<board>/board.dts and board.dtb from that board's factory kernel DTB.
#
# Two stages, so each is auditable on its own:
#   1. mechanical — decompile the factory blob. It does not round-trip byte for byte: dtc re-packs
#      the string table and writes path references where the vendor wrote phandles. The content is
#      what matters, and the patch's own -F0 gate catches a base that has moved.
#   2. judgement — apply firmware/<board>/board.patch, which says what we change and why.
#
# The submission set under upstream/ derives from the same two inputs, separately.
